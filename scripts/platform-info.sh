# deployed platform must still produce a useful report rather than an error.

# `set -e` is deliberately absent. Every lookup here is allowed to fail: the
# cluster, the CodeConnections connection, the ALB and the workload Ingresses
# each come into existence at a different stage, and the whole point of this
